# WallStreetBets-Sentiment-Dashboard
Code coming soon, needs to be cleaned before committing

Uses the praw, Dash, pandas, plotly, and vaderSentiment libraries. Scrapes r/wallstreetbets and displays a simple dashboard displaying a graph of a specified stock's 5 comment sentiment moving average. I'd love to hear ways to improve my code.
