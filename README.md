# WallStreetBets-Sentiment

The purpose of this code is to allow you the user to connect to Reddit's API via the Python Reddit API Wrapper, praw. It scrapes comments from the subreddit of your choice over up to the last 1000 posts, sorted by hot. It then creates a graph of the top 10 most mentioned comments, color coded to their sentiment, which is determined using vaderSentiment.
